2.User Defined Functions

We can use "fuction" keyword to create Functions
suntax :- 

1.simple fuction
fuction myFunction()
{
    statements
}

2. Arrow Fuction
syntax :-
const functionName = (par1,par2)=>{
    statements
}

Advantages :-
1. Increase code modularity
2. Reduce redundancy and lines of code
3. we can use / invoke functions wherever and whenever needed
4. We use camel case to name the functions


*Higher Order Functions :- Functions which takes functions as an argument or returns the functions as an arguments
